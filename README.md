# Text-Generation-with-a-Recurrent-Neural-Network
Text Genetation using characted based RNN.  We use a dataset of Shakespeare's writing from Andrej Karpathy's .. Given a sequence of characters from this data ("Shakespear"), a model is trained to predict the next character in the sequence. Longer sequences of text can be generated by calling the model repeatedly.
